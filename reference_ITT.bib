   abstract = {<p>This article reviews methods for comparative effectiveness research using observational data. The basic idea is using an observational study to emulate a hypothetical randomised trial by comparing initiators versus non-initiators of treatment. After adjustment for measured baseline confounders, one can then conduct the observational analogue of an intention-to-treat analysis. We also explain two approaches to conduct the analogues of per-protocol and as-treated analyses after further adjusting for measured time-varying confounding and selection bias using inverse-probability weighting. As an example, we implemented these methods to estimate the effect of statins for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from electronic medical records in the UK. Despite strong confounding by indication, our approach detected a potential benefit of statin therapy. The analogue of the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) of CHD was 0.89 (0.73, 1.09) for statin initiators versus non-initiators. The HR of CHD was 0.84 (0.54, 1.30) in the per-protocol analysis and 0.79 (0.41, 1.41) in the as-treated analysis for 2 years of use versus no use. In contrast, a conventional comparison of current users versus never users of statin therapy resulted in a HR of 1.31 (1.04, 1.66). We provide a flexible and annotated SAS program to implement the proposed analyses.</p>},

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT: Target trial emulation has drastically improved the
               quality of observational studies investigating the effects of
               interventions. Its ability to prevent avoidable biases that have
               plagued many observational analyses has contributed to its
               recent popularity. This review explains what target trial
               emulation is, why it should be the standard approach for causal
               observational studies that investigate interventions, and how to
               do a target trial emulation analysis. We discuss the merits of
               target trial emulation compared with often used, but biased
               analyses, as well as potential caveats, and provide clinicians
               and researchers with the tools to better interpret results from
               observational studies investigating the effects of
               interventions.",
