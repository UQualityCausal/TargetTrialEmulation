  abstract  = "ABSTRACT: Target trial emulation has drastically improved the
               quality of observational studies investigating the effects of
               interventions. Its ability to prevent avoidable biases that have
               plagued many observational analyses has contributed to its
               recent popularity. This review explains what target trial
               emulation is, why it should be the standard approach for causal
               observational studies that investigate interventions, and how to
               do a target trial emulation analysis. We discuss the merits of
               target trial emulation compared with often used, but biased
               analyses, as well as potential caveats, and provide clinicians
               and researchers with the tools to better interpret results from
               observational studies investigating the effects of
               interventions.",
